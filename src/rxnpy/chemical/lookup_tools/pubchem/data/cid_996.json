Additionally, phenol and its related compounds are used in surgical ingrown toenail treatment, a process termed phenolization. Research indicates that parental exposure to phenol and its related compounds are positively associated with spontaneous abortion. During the second world war, phenol injections were used as a means of execution by the Nazis. Phenol is a toxic compound whose vapours are corrosive to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example \"H2SO4\" for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version \"H2O4S.\"",

                          "String": "Phenol is an acutely hazardous substance due primarily to its toxicity. Because phenol is highly corrosive to skin and systemically toxic by all routes of exposure, including dermal absorption, it should not be allowed to contact skin in its normally crystalline or concentrated liquid form. When heated, phenol can give off vapors which are not only toxic, but flammable as well, if exposed to an ignition source. Compliance with the OSHA TLV of 5 ppm should protect against the build-up of both toxic and explosive concentrations of phenol in air. Under all circumstances where skin contact with phenol is possible, protective clothing, including gloves and a face shield, should be worn. This clothing should be made of material which is impervious to phenol eg neoprene, polyethylene, or rubber. Under conditions where airborne concentrations of phenol exceed 20 mg/cu meter, a full-face respiratory device is also required. Warning of potential phenol exposure can come from its sickeningly sweet, acrid odor, detectable at 0.047 ppm. Containers of phenol may be leaking if a check of the contents reveals phenol is turning reddish in color. Toxicity is the prime consideration in the safe storage and shipment of phenol. Designated as \"Poison B\" by the DOT, phenol containers are labeled \"Poison\". However, no special containers are required due to phenol's modest fire hazard and low reactivity. Should a phenol fire occur, it may be combatted with water spray, CO2, dry chemical or foam extinguishants. Aside from assuring that all containers and shipment vessels are securely closed, the toxicity and fire hazards of phenol can be greatly reduced by the prevention of overheating in storage areas. This is accomplished with proper ventilation. Spills of phenol should be flushed with water, and caustic soda solution added for neutralization. Phenol should not be allowed to come into contact with strong oxidizing agents, eg peroxodisulfuric acid.",

Flush victim's eyes with water or normal saline solution for 20 to 30 minutes while simultaneously calling a hospital or poison control center. Do not put any ointments, oils, or medication in the victim's eyes without specific instructions from a physician. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim after flushing eyes to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop.  SKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with water while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and water. IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital for treatment after washing the affected areas.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. If symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop, call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. Phenols are very toxic poisons AND corrosive and irritating, so that inducing vomiting may make medical problems worse. IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center and locate activated charcoal, egg whites, or milk in case the medical advisor recommends administering one of them. If advice from a physician is not readily available and the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give the victim a glass of activated charcoal slurry in water or, if this is not available, a glass of milk, or beaten egg whites and IMMEDIATELY transport victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, assure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

Cardiac arrhythmias may be noted. Weakness, headache, dizziness, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), delirium, and shock are common. Seizures may often be followed by coma. Pallor, profuse sweating, dilated pupils, and a profound drop in body temperature may occur. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, abdominal pain, bloody vomitus, and bloody diarrhea. Renal insufficiency may lead to hematuria (bloody urine). Liver damage may also occur. Phenol is corrosive to the skin and mucous membranes. Contact may result in severe and painful burns, which promptly become anesthetized (numb) to touch and pain. Ulceration may follow.  Emergency Life-Support Procedures: Acute exposure to phenol may require decontamination and life support for the victims. Emergency personnel should wear protective clothing appropriate to the type and degree of contamination. Air-purifying or supplied-air respiratory equipment should also be worn, as necessary. Rescue vehicles should carry supplies such as plastic sheeting and disposable plastic bags to assist in preventing spread of contamination.  Inhalation Exposure: 1. Move victims to fresh air. Emergency personnel should avoid self-exposure to phenol. 2. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma. If no pulse is detected, provide CPR. If not breathing, provide artificial respiration. If breathing is labored, administer oxygen or other respiratory support. 3. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of an antidote or performance of other invasive procedures. 4. Transport to a health care facility.  Dermal/Eye Exposure: 1. Remove victims from exposure. Emergency personnel should avoid self- exposure to phenol. 2. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma. If no pulse is detected, provide CPR. If not breathing, provide artificial respiration. If breathing is labored, administer oxygen or other respiratory support. 3. Remove contaminated clothing as soon as possible. 4. If eye exposure has occurred, eyes must be flushed with lukewarm water for at least 15 minutes. 5. Remove phenol from skin with undiluted polyethylene glycol 300 or 400, if available. If not available, use water. Follow polyethylene glycol wash with a water wash. 6. Wash exposed skin areas for at least 15 minutes with large amounts of water.  7. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of an antidote or performance of other invasive procedures. 8. Transport to a health care facility.  Ingestion Exposure:  1. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma. If no pulse is detected, provide CPR. If not breathing, provide artificial respiration. If breathing is labored, administer oxygen or other respiratory support. 2. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of an antidote or performance of other invasive procedures. 3. Immediately give the victims water or milk: children up to 1 year old, 125 mL (4 oz or 1/2 cup); children 1 to 12 years old, 200 mL (6 oz or 3/4 cup); adults, 250 mL (8 oz or 1 cup). Water or milk should be given only if victims are conscious and alert. 4. If a dilute (5% or less) solution has been ingested, vomiting may be induced with syrup of Ipecac. DO NOT induce vomiting if concentration is greater than 5% or unknown. If elapsed time since ingestion of phenol is unknown or suspected to be greater than 30 minutes, do not induce vomiting and proceed to Step  5. Ipecac should not be administered to children under 6 months of age.Warning: Ingestion of phenol may result in sudden onset of seizures or loss of consciousness. Syrup of Ipecac should be administered only if victims are alert, have an active gag-reflex, and show no signs of impending seizure or coma. If ANY uncertainty exists, proceed to Step  5.The following dosages of Ipecac are recommended: children up to 1 year old, 10 mL (1/3 oz); children 1 to 12 years old, 15 mL (1/2 oz); adults, 30 mL (1 oz). Ambulate (walk) the victims and give large quantities of water. If vomiting has not occurred after 15 minutes, Ipecac may be readministered. Continue to ambulate and give water to the victims. If vomiting has not occurred within 15 minutes after second administration of Ipecac, administer activated charcoal. 5. Activated charcoal may be administered if victims are conscious and alert. Use 15 to 30 g (1/2 to 1 oz) for children, 50 to 100 g (1-3/4 to 3-1/2 oz) for adults, with 125 to 250 mL (1/2 to 1 cup) of water. 6. Promote excretion by administering a saline cathartic or sorbitol to conscious and alert victims. Children require 15 to 30 g (1/2 to 1 oz) of cathartic; 50 to 100 g (1-3/4 to 3-1/2 oz) is recommended for adults. 7. Transport to a health care facility. (EPA, 1998)",

These materials are incompatible with strong reducing substances such as hydrides, nitrides, alkali metals, and sulfides. Flammable gas (H2) is often generated, and the heat of the reaction may ignite the gas. Heat is also generated by the acid-base reaction between phenols and bases. Such heating may initiate polymerization of the organic compound. Phenols are sulfonated very readily (for example, by concentrated sulfuric acid at room temperature). The reactions generate heat. Phenols are also nitrated very rapidly, even by dilute nitric acid. Phenol may explode in contact with peroxodisulfuric acid (D'Ans, J. Ber., 1910, 43, 1880; Z. Anorg.

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Phenol is found on List D. Case No: 4074; Pesticide type: antimicrobial; Case Status: OPP is reviewing data from the pesticide's producers regarding its human health and/or environmental effects, or OPP is determining the pesticide's eligibility for reregistration and developing the Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) document.; Active ingredient (AI): Phenol; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 09/30/93; AI Status: The producers of the pesticide has made commitments to conduct the studies and pay the fees required for reregistration, and are meeting those commitments in a timely manner.",

Some individuals may be hypersensitive with lethality or serious effects at very low exposures. Rapid absorption and severe systemic toxicity can occur after any route of exposure including skin. Death and severe toxicity are usually due to effects on the CNS, heart, blood vessels, lung, and kidneys. However, toxic manifestations may vary somewhat with the route. Observed effects from acute exposure may include: shock, delirium, coma, pulmonary distress, phenolic breath, scanty/dark urine, and death. Protracted or chronic exposure usually results in major damage to the liver, kidneys and eyes. Pigmentary changes of the skin have been noted. Consumption of water contaminated with phenol resulted in diarrhea, mouth sores, burning of the mouth, and dark urine. Phenol is highly caustic to tissues. Skin exposure results in pain, then numbness, blanching, severe burns, and eschar formation. Ingestion leads to burning of throat and severe gastrointestinal inflammation. Inhalation can result in pulmonary irritation and edema. ANIMAL TOXICITY: Toxicity in animals is similar to that of humans, although additional effects have been observed. LD50's in animals range from 250-500 mg/kg, differing very little with route of exposure or species, except for the cat which is unusually susceptible with an oral lethal dose of 80 mg/kg. Additional reported toxic effects include irritation and corrosivity of skin and eyes in rabbits, induction of skin tumors in mice, reproductive effects in rats, and mutagenicity with Salmonella, E coli and Drosophila. Phenol is also highly toxic to aquatic life and frogs. METABOLISM: Phenol is metabolized and excreted principally by the kidneys as the sulfate or glucuronide, although some phenol may be excreted unchanged, especially at high doses. Other reported metabolites include hydroquinone, other quinones and catechols.",

Finally, 5 unoperated primates and 5 primates that received only 2 ml of radiographic contrast material served as control subjects. Two weeks after the epidural injection, spinal cords were removed and processed for histopathologic study by a neuropathologist blinded to the soln administered. None of the control animals demonstrated histopathologic changes. One animal that received 6% phenol died 3 days after injection. All phenol-treated animals demonstrated predominantly posterior root damage. Spinal cord damage was seen in all animals receiving 6% phenol, in 2 animals receiving 3% phenol single doses, and in neither animal receiving 3% phenol multiple doses. Anterior root damage occurred in all phenol-treated animals except the 4 that received single 3% phenol injections. Animals that received 6% phenol demonstrated greater lower extremity motor weakness than those in the other groups, but no clear correlation existed between extent of histopathologic changes and motor weakness.",

To understand the mechanisms underlying these synergistic genotoxic effects we have studied the origin of micronuclei (MN) formed in bone marrow erythrocytes following the co-admin of these 2 metabolites. Phenol and hydroquinone were administered to male CD-1 mice by ip injection 3 times at 24 hr intervals. The frequency of MN was evaluated in bone marrow cells harvested 24 hr following the final dose. A marked incr in MN was observed in mice co-administered phenol and hydroquinone, which was significantly greater than that observed with the individual metabolites. Labeling with the CREST antibody and multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization with the mouse major and minor satellite probes indicated that both chromosomal loss and breakage and occurred. The major incr in MN induced by the phenol and hydroquinone combination originated from breakage in the euchromatic region of the mouse chromosomes. The origin of MN in mice co-administered phenol and hydroquinone differed substantially from that induced by hydroquinone alone, but was almost identical to that seen in MN from benzene-treated mice. These results strongly support the hypothesis that interactive effects among benzene metabolites play an important role in the genotoxic and carcinogenic effects of benzene.",

The first response is usually to remove and dispose of contaminated clothing, and to flood the exposed area with copious amounts of water to decr the thermal burn and to mechanically remove the phenol. However, phenol is not readily soluble in cold water, so supplemental decontamination procedures have been investigated which are more likely than water alone to remove phenol from the epidermis before it can cause local and/or systemic damage. ... Polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) was an effective agent for the treatment of shaved rats exposed cutaneously for a period of 4 hr to a lethal dose of phenol. After 4 hr of exposure, the rats were dipped into the decontaminating liquid. All rats, prior to dipping, showed convulsions, but all rats treated with PEG 400 survived. The disadvantage of PEG 400 is that at low (winter) temperatures it becomes a viscous liquid and becomes difficult to use. ... /Another study/ recommend/s/ swabbing all contaminated skin for at least 10 min with cotton wool soaked in glycerol, PEG 300, or a PEG/methylated spirit mixture (ethyl alcohol, denatured with methanol). ... Swabbing alone /was found/ to be ineffective, but ...a substantial therapeutic effect was achieved if the swabs were soaked in the above mentioned solvents. ...The best emergency treatment will be to force an effective diluent into the epidermis before phenol, which is retained there, can be absorbed through the necrotic barrier it has created. ... In another study PEG 400 and 300 were the most effective decontaminating agents, increasing the period of lethal exposure of the rats almost 25-fold; it made little difference whether the animals were immersed in PEG or swabbed with this compound. However, both undiluted PEG 300 and 400 caused a heat sensation that may contribute to the thermal burn of heated phenol. The addn of a solvent to PEG reduces viscosity making the mixture useful at lower temp, and may incr the overall efficacy. However, addn of ethanol as a solvent may make the decontamination liquid flammable.",

In severe intoxication, the lungs may show hyperemia, infarcts, bronchopneumonia, purulent bronchitis, and hyperplasia of the peribronchial tissues. Myocardial degeneration and necrosis can be present. The hepatic cells may be enlarged, pale, and coarsely granular with swollen fragmented and pyknotic nuclei. Prolonged administration of phenol may cause parenchymatous nephritis, hyperemia, edema of the convoluted tubules, and degenerative changes of the glomeruli. Blood cells become hyaline, with granules. Marked striation of the muscle fibers is also seen.",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of 14.6 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm. During the nighttime, phenol reacts with nitrate radicals with a resulting half-life of 12 minutes. If released to soil, phenol is expected to have high mobility based upon Koc values that are generally below 100. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.33X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. The pKa of phenol is 9.99, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in its un-ionized form at environmental conditions. Phenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure 0.35 mm Hg at 25 °C. Phenol's degradation in soil is completed in 2-5 days, even in subsurface soils. If released into water, phenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values of 2900 and 3100 for fine and coarse sediment, respectively. Phenol completely mineralized in <1 day in water from 3 lakes; rates increase with increasing concns of phenol and the organic content of the water. It was completely removed in river water after 2 days at 20 °C and after 4 days at 4 °C. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon phenol's Henry's Law constant. The BCFs reported in fish include: Goldorfe, 20; goldfish (Carassius auratus), 1.9; fish (unspecified), 17; fish (unspecified), 1.7; and 39, rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri). The reported BCF values and the rapid elimination of phenol suggests that bioaccumulation of phenol is unlikely. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process, since phenol lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to phenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with phenol at workplaces where phenol is produced or used or via inhalation and dermal absorption of phenol-containing wastewater, emissions and disinfectants or solvents. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to phenol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer or medicinal products containing phenol. Dermal absorption of phenol may also occur from contact with decomposing organic matter than may contain phenol. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces would not be expected to be a major fate process(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.33X10-7 atm cu m/mol at 25 °C(4). The pKa of phenol is 9.99(5), indicating that phenol will primarily exist in its un-ionized form in the environment. The BCFs reported in fish include: Goldorfe, 20(6); goldfish (Carassius auratus), 1.9(7); fish (unspecified), 17(8); fish (unspecified), 1.7(9); and 39, rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri)(10). According to a classification scheme(11), reported BCF values and the rapid elimination of phenol suggests that bioaccumulation of phenol is unlikely(SRC). According to a classification scheme(11), BCF values <30 are low and from 100 or greater are high. No oxidants were formed when an aqueous phenol solution was irradiated with sunlight for 5 hours(12). Phenol is completely mineralized in <1 day in water from 3 lakes; rates increase with increasing concns of phenol and the organic content of the water (e.g., degraded faster in an eutrophic lake than an oligotropic one)(13). Phenol was completely removed in river water after 2 days at 20 °C and after 4 days at 4 °C(14). The rates of photolysis in summer sunlight (24 °C, midday surface irradiance 4.9 E/sq m-hr) and winter (10 °C, midday surface irradiance 2.9 E/sq m-hr) were determined in distilled water (0.016 M phosphate buffer and treated with 0.4% formaldehyde), poisoned estuarine water (treated with 0.4% formaldehyde), and estuarine waster, all at pH 7.7, using ring-UL-14C-labeled phenol in a flask suspended 3 cm below the surface of water in an outdoor tank of circulating estuarine water(15). The phototransformation half-lives in distilled, poisoned estuarine water, and estuarine water were 46, 43, and 39 hours in summer, respectively, and 173, 118, and 94 hours in winter, respectively(15). The photomineralization (CO2 appearance) half-lives in distilled, poisoned estuarine water, and estuarine water were 16, 16, and 7 days in summer, respectively, and 169, 110, and 73 days in winter, respectively(15).",

The measured rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of phenol with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals is 2.63X10-11 cu cm/molecule s at 25 °C(3). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of 14.6 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(SRC). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of phenol with nitrate radicals is 3.92X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 23 °C(4,5). This corresponds to a half-life of 12 minutes at a nitrate radical concn of 2.4X10+8 per cu cm (over continental areas)(SRC). The reaction with nitrate radicals is only important during the nighttime(SRC). Phenol does not absorb UV radiation >290(6), and would not be expected to undergo direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Only selected results are included here (SRC). In a 2-week biodegradation screening test (MITI test) using phenol (100 mg/l) and an activated sludge inoculum, 85% of theoretical BOD was removed(1). Phenol was completely removed in 1 day or less using a soil suspension(2) or activated sludge inocula(3,6). Complete degradation was observed in 4 days using sediment from an oil refinery settling pond as an inoculum(4). It was shown that the presence of aromatic compounds like benzene and naphthalene had a mild inhibitory effect on degradation(4). In five days, the BOD consumed was 90% and 50% of theoretical using a sewage inoculum and freshwater and seawater, respectively(5). Another investigator who obtained 80% of theoretical BOD consumed after 5 days demonstrated that adaptation of the inoculum has a marked effect on the biodegradation rate(8). Decreasing the concn of phenol significantly reduces the lag time required to initiate degradation and increases the removal rate(9). The maximum mineralization rates of phenol in sewage and landfill leachate were 6.5X10-4 and 2.7X10-4 hr-1, respectively(7). A lag period was observed in landfill leachate(7).",

Degradation is slower in salt water; the degradation rate in the estuarine Skidway River, GA was 0.079 hr-1 (half-life 9 days)(1). Laboratory tests were conducted to ascertain the seasonal mineralization of trace levels of 14C-phenol by heterotrophic microorganisms in seston and surface sediment at four sites in southwestern Virginia(2). The mean turnover rates for the four sites between April and May 1986 at 10 °C were 0.015, 0.023, 0.023, and 0.064 mg/hr sediment ash-free dry wt (AFDW)(2). Mineralization reached a maximum of 1.21X10-4 to 1.16X10-3 mg phenol mineralized/mg AFDW-hr in October, an increase of 92-625% for seston samples and 46-128% for sediment samples over baseline August levels, despite decreasing stream temperatures(2). This autumnal peak in phenol degradation is attributed to the pulsed input of allochthonous detritus, especially leaf litter which contains substantial quantities of phenol and related compounds(2).",

Phenol will be partially dissociated at the upper end of environmental pH range (e.g. 1% of phenol will be dissociated at pH 8 and 10% at pH 9) and its reactivity may be pH dependent(SRC). Phenol does not absorb UV radiation >290 nm(6); therefore, in the absence of photosensitizers, phenol is not susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). The phenolate ion absorbs light more strongly and at longer wavelengths than phenol(7), and may be susceptible to direct photolysis(SRC). Phenol may undergo indirect photolysis in natural waters due to reaction with transients generated by the absorption of sunlight by, for example, dissolved natural organic matter; some of the oxidants that have been identified include hydroxyl radicals, peroxy radicals(4), singlet oxygen(2) and reactive excited triplet states(5). Typical half-lives for hydroxyl and peroxy radical reactions are on the order of 100 and 19.2 hrs of sunlight, respectively(4). The rate constant of phenolate ion and phenol with singlet oxygen are 1.55X10+08 L/mol-sec and 2.6X10+06, respectively(2). Assuming a near surface concn of singlet oxygen of 2X10-13 mol/l(3), the half-lives of the phenolate ion and undissociated phenol would respectively be 6.2 hr and 370 hr(SRC). Another investigator estimated the half-life for reaction of phenol with photochemically-produced singlet oxygen in surface waters contaminated by humic substances as 83 days (assuming Switzerland summer sunlight and singlet oxygen concn 4X10-14 mol/l)(8).",

Phenol is not susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight except at very high pH (>10); however, in the presence of riboflavin, phenol is rapidly decomposed in the pH range 5 to 9 with a light source (>290 nm)(1). In another experiment using light from a solar simulator, the pseudo first-order rate constants of lumichrome-sensitized photolysis of phenol was 2.2, 3.5, and 17.0 1/min at pH 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0, respectively(2).",

Phenol was rapidly eliminated from goldfish(6) and therefore would be unlikely to bioaccumulate(SRC). When U-14C-phenol was interperitonially administered to goldfish, the concn decreased to one tenth the initial concn in 2 hr(6). A BCF of 15,800 was reported in fathead minnows using 14C labeled phenol(7). Minor amounts of 14C in tissues were present as parent compound after 28 days of exposure to radiolabeled phenol(7). Parent compound comprised 1.5% of total 14C as phenol after 28 days of depuration(7). According to a classification scheme(8), reported BCF values and the rapid elimination of phenol suggests that bioaccumulation of phenol is unlikely(SRC). According to a classification scheme, BCF values <30 are low and from 100 or greater are high(8).",

The Koc for phenol to a Batcombe silt loam soil (pH 6.7, organic carbon 2.51%) was 30(6). It was 16 for a Brookstone clay loam (pH 5.7, organic matter 5.1%) and varied with pH and iron content of the soil(7). The Freundlich K and (1/N) for phenol in Captina (pH 5.7, 1.1 % organic matter) and Palouse silt loam (pH 5.7, 3.6% organic matter) soils were 0.58 (1.15) and 0.81 (1.00)(2); the Koc values for these soils are 91 and 39(SRC). Based on the reported Koc values, phenol would be expected to generally exhibit very high mobility in soil, based on a classification scheme(4). In a study of the adsorption of phenol onto siltstone associated with a Wyoming coal deposit suitable for in situ gasification, the pH of the solution was the major controlling factor with adsorption occurring at pH's below the pKa of phenol and no adsorption occurring at pH's above the pKa(5). The log of the Freundlich K value was approximately -4(5). Therefore, phenol may be transported by groundwater near in situ coal gasification sites due to the elevated pH's at these sites after gasification(5). The pKa of phenol is 9.99(9), indicating that it will be partially dissociated at the upper end of environmental pH range and its mobility may be pH dependent(SRC). In general, anions generally do not adsorb to organic carbon and clay as strongly as their neutral counterparts(10).",

Concn of phenol in 2 aquifers, 15 months after completion of coal gasification project in Northeastern Wyoming were 6.5 to 10,000 ppb(2). Phenol was detected in wells in an alluvial aquifer near Zagreb, Yugoslavia at 10 to 100 ng/l; the wells were near a wastewater canal that received untreated wastes from the pharmaceutical industry that contained phenol levels exceeding 1000 ng/l(3). Phenol was not detected in wells near the Sava River, which contained phenol in the 1 to 10 ng/l range(3). Phenol concns were measured in groundwater at three creosote contaminated sites in Denmark(4). At a former asphalt factory in Ringe that operated from 1915 to 1954, phenol concns in groundwater were 87, 37, and 62 ug/l at 0, 25, and 25 meters from the source(4). At Holte Sollerod Gasworks (1907-1963), phenol concns were 279, 47, and 17 ug/l at 0, 5, and 10 meters from the source(4). At Frederica Gasworks (1866-1966), phenol concns were 496, 11, 56, 19, and 18 ug/l at 0, 2.5, 25, 25, and 55 meters from the source(4). Phenol concns in the vicinity of a wood-treatment plant near Pensacola Florida were measured(5). Phenol concns at sampling depths 25, 9, 27, 15, 60, and 59 feet were 5.21, 4.21, <0.03, <0.03, 1.15 and <0.03 mg/l at 100, 450, 550, 1,300, 100, and 500 feet from the south embankment of the overflow pond(5). Estimated concns of phenol in two samples from one Superfund site were reported to be 154 and 64 mg/l of organic carbon(6). Phenol was detected in groundwater at about 17 ppb near a landfill in central Florida(7).",

Phenol was detected, but not quantified in 2 of 110 raw water supplies in 1977 analyzed in EPA National Organics Monitoring Survey(4). From the USEPA STORET database, of 1,754 data points, 13.0% were positive for phenol with 5.0 ppb as a median concn(5). In northern Alberta in a region of a pulp mill, phenol was not detected (detection limit 0.02 ug/l)in 12 samples taken in the fall and summer of 1990(6). Phenol was present in the Sava River, Yugoslavia near Zagreb at a level of about 1 to 10 ng/l(8). The concentration of phenol in the Rio Santiago, Argentina was 40 mg/l(7). This river receives effluents from a large petrochemical and oil refinery complex, a steel rolling mill and shipyards(7). Phenol was detected in surface water at about 15 ppb near a landfill in Orange County, Florida(9). A study of the occurrence of organic wastewater contaminates in U.S. 139 streams (1999-2000) found phenol at a frequency of 8.2% with maximum and median concns of 1.3 and 0.7 ug/l, respectively(10).",

Phenol concns of 1540, 39,100, 2400, and 256 ng/g were determined in the volatile component of Korean salt-fermented fish and shrimp pastes from a Korean market that were made from anchovy, big eyed herring, hair tail viscera, and shrimp, respectively(7). The volatile components of different meats of a commonly consumed crab in Asia (Charybdis feriatus) were investigated(8). It was determined that phenol concentrations (ug/kg dry weight) in the following crab meats were 9.1 (legs and claws), 12.0 (body), and 78.8 (carapace)(8). The volatile components of three commercial brands of fermented soybean curds were analyzed, and contained phenol concns of 5747.9, 6077.4, and 445.1 ug/kg, dry weight(9). Naturally occurring volatiles of Australian blue gum honey were isolated and the mean phenol concentration was 0.5 mg/kg(10).

Aqueous phenol solutions have therapeutic uses include topical anesthetic, topical antiseptic and topical antipuritic(2). Therapeutic veterinary applications of phenol include uses as a topical anesthetic and as an internal and external antiseptic(2). Occupational exposure to phenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with phenol at workplaces where phenol is produced or used or via inhalation and dermal absorption of phenol-containing wastewater, emissions and disinfectants or solvents(SRC). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to phenol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer or medicinal products containing phenol(SRC). Dermal absorption of phenol may also occur from contact with decomposing organic matter than may contain phenol(SRC).",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",
